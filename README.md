# Arduino Project 01 â€“ Basic Circuits with LED and Switches

**Goal:**  
Refresh knowledge about current, voltage, and resistance, and get familiar with using a breadboard and the Arduino as a power source.  
This project focuses on understanding how switches affect the flow of current in series and parallel configurations.

## Components
- Arduino Uno (used only as 5 V power supply)
- Breadboard
- 1 LED (red)
- 1 kÎ© resistor
- 2 push-button switches
- Jumper wires (orange for +5 V, yellow for GND)

## Circuit Parts

### ðŸ”¹ Part 1 â€“ Single Switch
- A single switch is placed in series with the LED and resistor.  
- The LED lights up **only when the switch is pressed**, completing the circuit.

### ðŸ”¹ Part 2 â€“ Two Switches in Series
- Two switches are connected **in series**.  
- The LED lights up **only when both switches are pressed** (logical AND behavior).  
- Demonstrates that current can only flow when both switches are closed.

### ðŸ”¹ Part 3 â€“ Two Switches in Parallel
- Two switches are connected **in parallel**.  
- The LED lights up **if either switch is pressed** (logical OR behavior).  
- Demonstrates multiple current paths in a parallel connection.

## Notes
- The Arduino board was used only to provide a stable 5 V supply (no programming required).  
- The resistor limits the current to protect the LED.  
- Using a higher resistor value (1 kÎ© instead of 220 Î©) makes the LED slightly dimmer but keeps it safe.
